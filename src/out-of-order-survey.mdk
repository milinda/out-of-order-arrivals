~ Abstract
Stream processing enables faster decision making and reduces response times by processing data on arrival. A data stream
is an unbounded sequence of tuples, often logically ordered by time. But at internet scale, these streams are often
arrives out-of-order with respect to the creation time and vaious kinds of disruptions occurr during the stream
delivery. So employing mechanisms to handle out-of-order arrivals and stream distruptions are important. This paper
explores existing work on out-of-order arrival handling in stream processing systems.
